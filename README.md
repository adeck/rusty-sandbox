## What is this?

I've meant to get around to learning Rust for years, other things always seemed to get in the way.
Now I'm doing it in earnest.

This repo was created when I originally planned to learn the language.
The repo languished since then.
Reason being that I approached rust the way I'd approached learning other programming languages- namely, that I assumed I already knew most of what I needed to know and that the main obstacle would be syntax.
I assumed I could jump straight into a project.
This was misinformed.
I needed a solid grasp of the fundamentals of the language, specifically the memory management, which differs from that of essentially every other language I have used.
