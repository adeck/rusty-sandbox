## What is this?

I'm going through the [rust book][] one chapter at a time.
Every time I sit down to learn rust, before I get into the book, I validate that I can write some of the exercise programs from previous chapters correctly from memory.
Not verbatim, but close enough that:

1. It runs properly, and
2. I am satisfied that I have understood the concepts well enough to apply them without doubt or hesitation.

We'll see if this strategy bears fruit.
